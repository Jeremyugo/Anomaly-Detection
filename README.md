# Anomaly Detection - Multivariate Time Series Data

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for performing anomaly detection on multivariate time series data.

## Overview

Anomaly detection can be performed on both univariate (single feature) and multivariate (multiple features) time series data. This notebook demonstrates various techniques for anomaly detection using both approaches.

## Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pyod
- scikit-learn
- adtk
- seaborn

## Data

The notebook utilizes Daily Delhi Climate data for training and testing. The training data is loaded from "DailyDelhiClimateTrain.csv", and the testing data is loaded from "DailyDelhiClimateTest.csv".

## Result - anomalous instances
